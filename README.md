### Store Date Info Plus MOD

> It's a mod that has the same premise as Store Date Info, but much more complete and more practical to use.

In Builder mode you can build your date your way without having to take variable by variable. It may seem confusing, but just look at the example in mod.

You can see the documentation of the module that is used to better understand, I recommend <a href="https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/">this part</a>, there it shows all the parameters you can use in "Build It" field.

### Check If Command Exists MOD

> Check if such a command exists.

**Note:** It also works with General Wrex's Multiple Prefixes Raw Data.

**NoteÂ²:** The following preview is just an example of what she can do, which is not the only way. Use you brain. =)
